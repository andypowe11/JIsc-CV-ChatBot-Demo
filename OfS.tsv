I don't think my university or college is doing enough: a) to prevent the spread of coronavirus, or b) to support students in the current situation. What should I do?	Students with concerns should first raise these with their university, college or other higher education provider.\n\nStudents can escalate complaints with the [Office of the Independent Adjudicator](https://www.oiahe.org.uk/) (OIA) once they have exhausted the complaints procedure at their higher education provider.\n\nThe OfS does not have a direct role in individual student complaints, but students or organisations or members of the public may [tell us](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/contact/complaints-and-notifications/) about any issue that may be of regulatory interest to us.\n\nThe OfS will then consider this as part of our overall regulation of the provider.	http://andypowe11.net/ofs.html		[]	false	[]	464

What support should students with care experience, refugees, estranged students and other vulnerable groups expect from their university or college?	The government has asked universities and colleges to make sure that certain groups of students get the support that they need during the coronavirus outbreak. These include\n\n*   international students\n\n*   care leavers\n\n*   estranged students\n\n*   disabled students\n\n*   students who live with people in high risk groups.\n\nUniversities and colleges should ensure that the following support is in place for these groups:\n\n*   Guaranteed appropriate accommodation. If it is safe and feasible vulnerable students should have the option to remain in their accommodation. If students are required to move, universities and colleges should make sure that those students can get the practical assistance that they need.\n\n*   Continued access to established financial support, and to immediate hardship funding if necessary. Where universities and colleges are likely to be impacted by staff shortages or office closures this may need to be paid to vulnerable students in advance.\n\n*   Practical support to access food, medical and cleaning supplies.\n\n*   Ongoing access to a first point of contact for student queries and concerns and for proactive wellbeing support.\n\n*   Ongoing access to student support networks, mental health support and academic support where required.\n\nIf you are concerned that your university or college is not providing enough support for these groups of students, please raise it with them in the first instance.\n\nStudents can escalate complaints with the [Office of the Independent Adjudicator](https://www.oiahe.org.uk/) once they have exhausted the complaints procedure at their higher education provider.	http://andypowe11.net/ofs.html		[]	false	[]	467
What mental health support can I expect from my university or college during the coronavirus pandemic?	The OfS recognises that this is an anxious time for many. Universities and colleges should be providing clear and accessible information about mental health and wellbeing support for their full student population.\n\nThis includes continuing to provide appropriate support for students who have an existing mental health condition that they have declared to their university or college.\n\nMany universities and colleges have been quick to respond to the emerging and challenging situation including through moving support services such as counselling and mentoring to phone or online.\n\nIf you have concerns about your mental health, it is important to get in touch with your university or college.\n\nFor more information about other organisations which may be able to support you, please see our [mental health resources for students](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/student-wellbeing-and-protection/mental-health/resources-for-students/) webpage.	http://andypowe11.net/ofs.html		[]	false	[]	468

What should universities and colleges be doing to help students to continue with courses and assessments?	The OfS have published [guidance for universities and colleges](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/publications/guidance-for-providers-about-quality-and-standards-during-coronavirus-pandemic/) about how the OfS will regulate quality and standards during this period of disruption.

I am a degree apprentice. How will my studies and assessment be affected?

It outlines new, temporary measures being introduced to support apprentices to be able to complete their apprenticeship, pause or continue their apprenticeship and to support training providers during this time.	http://andypowe11.net/ofs.html		[]	false	[]	473

A university or college recently switched my offer from conditional to unconditional. Is this now in jeopardy?	The university or college that you applied to should be able to confirm details of any existing offer that you have from them, and there will be greater certainty for all applicants once universities and colleges have had time to understand how the process for qualifications will work this year.\n\nIt is really important to remember that you do not need to accept your offer right now.

Is the OfS against unconditional offers? I would like to have an unconditional offer and some certainty about what is happening.	Part of the OfS's job is to make sure that access to higher education is fair for everyone. In these unprecedented circumstances, the OfS believes that it is in the interests of all applicants to pause any unconditional offer-making and any changes to offers until there is wider understanding about how the process for qualifications will work this year. Otherwise there is a risk that applicants will be encouraged to make a decision that is not in their best interests.\n\nThe Ofs appreciates that applicants may want some certainty but it is important that the admissions process is fair for everyone.\n\nIt is really important to remember that you do not need to accept your offer right now.

I attended an audition, sat an entrance exam, or submitted a portfolio, why haven't I got an offer?	Offers following these processes are normally unconditional and so cannot be made at this time. You should wait until after the pause on unconditional offer-making has ended to make decisions so that you can do so in the knowledge of all your offers.	http://andypowe11.net/ofs.html		[]	false	[]	476
