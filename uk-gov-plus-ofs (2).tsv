What support should students with care experience, refugees, estranged students and other vulnerable groups expect from their university or college?

These include\n\n*   international students\n\n*   care leavers\n\n*   estranged students\n\n*   disabled students\n\n*   students who live with people in high risk groups.\n\nUniversities and colleges should ensure that the following support is in place for these groups:\n\n*   Guaranteed appropriate accommodation. If it is safe and feasible vulnerable students should have the option to remain in their accommodation. If students are required to move, universities and colleges should make sure that those students can get the practical assistance that they need.\n\n*   Continued access to established financial support, and to immediate hardship funding if necessary. Where universities and colleges are likely to be impacted by staff shortages or office closures this may need to be paid to vulnerable students in advance.\n\n*   Practical support to access food, medical and cleaning supplies.\n\n*   Ongoing access to a first point of contact for student queries and concerns and for proactive wellbeing support.\n\n*   Ongoing access to student support networks, mental health support and academic support where required.\n\nIf you are concerned that your university or college is not providing enough support for these groups of students, please raise it with them in the first instance.\n\nStudents can escalate complaints with the [Office of the Independent Adjudicator](https://www.oiahe.org.uk/) once they have exhausted the complaints procedure at their higher education provider.	ofs (2).tsv		[]	false	[]	245

Can I exercise more than once a day if I need to due to a significant health condition?	The government says that you can leave your home for medical need. If you (or a person in your care) have a specific health condition that requires you to leave the home to maintain your health - including if that involves travel beyond your local area - then you can do so. This could, for example, include where individuals with learning disabilities or autism require specific exercise in an open space two or three times each day - ideally in line with a care plan agreed with a medical professional.\n\nEven in such cases, in order to reduce the spread of infection and protect those exercising, travel outside of the home should be limited, as close to your local area as possible, and you should remain at least 2 metres apart from anyone who is not a member of your household or a carer at all times.	uk-gov (2).tsv		[]	false	[]	269
