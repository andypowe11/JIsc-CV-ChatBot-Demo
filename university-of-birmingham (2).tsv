Will I be entitled to a refund or compensation as a result of changes due to COVID-19?	Our response to the current crisis, and circumstances that are outside of our control, has been to prioritise the wellbeing and progression for all students.

Can I still apply for an extension or Extenuating Circumstances?	We would encourage all students to complete any outstanding assignments, dissertations and course work where you can, including any alternative assessments you may be set to complete your award or progress to the next level of your programme. However, we do understand that the disruption to studying, caused by the pandemic, will undoubtedly cause difficulties for many individuals.  Students can continue to seek short deadline extensions and make claims for Extenuating Circumstances in the normal way through your School or College process.  We will take a flexible and supportive approach to these decisions and we do not expect that students will have to provide the normal level of evidence for these – meaning that we do not require you to submit evidence, for example medical evidence or Doctors letters.  We understand that students may have additional caring responsibilities or other circumstances for which you may not be able to provide evidence and we will recognise this on a case by case basis.  [Further information about the Extenuating Circumstances process is available here](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/registry/policy/extcircs/index.aspx).

What is the University's latest advice for University of Birmingham exchange students on overseas placement in 2019/20?	Wherever you are in the world we hope that you are all safe and well.  During this unprecedented period, as the global community responds to tackling the COVID-19 outbreak, our priorities have always been to support your wellbeing, support your studies and provide the most up to date advice. \n\nIn all of our advice to you over the recent months the University has adhered closely to the UK Government advice for travellers and the specific advice for students who are studying or working overseas.   When we wrote to you last on 24th March 2020 our recommendations were provided based on the current advice - **that advice has now changed.**\n\n**SUMMARY: **\n\nThe advice of the UK Government now states:\n\n*   **All UK students and staff currently studying on exchanges (for example, Erasmus+, or terms abroad) or working temporarily overseas are advised to return to the UK now, while commercial routes are still available**\n\n*   **If UK students currently overseas for longer periods, for example those studying full degrees, are considering returning to the UK, they should do so while commercial routes are still available.**\n\n**The University is now strongly recommending that all UK nationals should observe the UK Government advice (updated 25/03) and return to the UK now.**\n\n**Students who are not UK nationals are advised to follow the recommendations of their home country Government, observing any travel restrictions and advice.**\n\n **Why has the University advice changed?**\n\nLate on 25th March 2020 the detailed guidance for UK students already studying or working overseas was revised by the UK Government.  \n\n**[The full advice is available from this link and we recommend that you read this carefully.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-advice-for-educational-settings/coronavirus-travel-guidance-for-educational-settings)**\n\nWhat this means is that our advice to you must also change, in line with the UK Government advice for UK nationals, and the advice from our travel insurance providers UMAL.\n\nWe recognise that this will be disappointing but would like to reassure you that we will make all best endeavours for you to be able to progress on your course normally, including the option to continue studying with your host institution via distance learning.\n\n **What you should do now.**\n\n**If you are a UK National we recommend that you follow the UK Government advice and make immediate travel plans to return to the UK.**\n\n**Advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)**\n\n*   International travel is becoming very limited as air routes cease, land borders close and new restrictions are put in place that prevent flights from leaving.\n\n*   If you are considering returning to the UK, you should contact your airline or travel company now, and keep up-to-date with FCO[travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice).\n\n*   FCO teams around the world are working urgently to ensure that governments have sensible plans to enable the return of British and other travellers, and, crucially, to keep borders open for a sufficient period of time to enable returns to take place on commercial routes, wherever possible. FCO is also working with airlines to ensure as many people as possible can get commercial flights home.\n\n*   UK travellers abroad should keep up to date with travel advice for the country/territory they are in.\n\n*   FCO has published [advice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus#if-youre-abroad-and-you-want-to-return-to-the-uk) for British nationals who do not have immediate departure options available to them.\n\n*   FCO is working with airlines to keep routes open and is calling for international action to keep routes open to enable British people to return home on commercial flights. We are also working around the clock to support those British travellers who are experiencing difficulties coming back to the UK.\n\n*   If you intend to return to the UK, you should use appropriate methods of travel. You need to take account of the fast-moving situation and plan accordingly, including the fact there are currently fewer commercial routes available.\n\n*   You should continue to monitor the [travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice) issued by the FCO and comply with any coronavirus (COVID-19) control measures put in place by your host nation.\n\n**Advice from the University:**\n\nIf you are leaving your host country / host institution you should let them know.  Your host institution may already have supportive arrangements in place for you to leave.\n\nIf you are leaving your host country / host institution **please let us know. ** You can contact us for advice and information via:  **[coronavirusupdates@contacts.bham.ac.uk](mailto:coronavirusupdates@contacts.bham.ac.uk)**\n\nYour host institution may already have arrangements in place for you to continue your studies with at a distance.  Where this is possible, this is the best option.\n\nWhere you cannot complete your semester/year abroad, we will make further arrangements to support your academic progression upon your return to the UK.  This may require individual advice for your specific programme and we will provide further updates as soon as possible.\n\n**What if I cannot leave my host country due to travel restrictions? / I do not want to return to the UK?**\n\n**Advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)**\n\n*   Travellers currently overseas should be prepared for border closures or lockdown measures being introduced at short notice.\n\n*   If you are abroad, you must follow the advice of local authorities and also follow the latest FCO [travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus).
